<meta name="description" content="What Year Car Is Considered An Antique, The united kingdom requires that the vehicle was built before. Essentially, it’s anything older than 45 years old, which makes 1976 the cutoff year (for now).
Average U.S. car is 11.4 years old, a record high From money.cnn.com
Some vintage cars quality as antique cars, but not all vintage cars are antique and vice versa. Different groups set different cut off points for what qualifies as a vintage car and what does not. A car that has been significantly modified may no longer qualify as a classic. However, some states consider anything made after the end of the forties a classic, and anything from 1949 back to.
