Lighter and stronger metals such as aluminum and magnesium are used for many parts in the early 21st century. Although there are other metals used, such as copper, platinum, palladium, rhodium, tin, lead and a few others, steel accounts for more than half of a car�s weight, according to the world steel. Heavy they were, but weight did not matter at a time when fuel was inexpensive and plentiful. But this caused a problem.

<p>This process coats steel with a layer of zinc, most typically by “hot dipping” components in a molten vat of the metal (although painted components see a thinner layer deposited via electroplating). Lighter and stronger metals such as aluminum and magnesium are used for many parts in the early 21st century. During this time many vehicles were being manufactured. They started using different designs and materials to decrease the weight of the vehicles. The metal itself is stronger in the modern car, but specifically designed to fail (and absorb energy) under the right circumstances.</p>

In the retro car the steel is designed to be as strong as possible and resist failure, but as a result when it does fail, fails in ways that are bad for the passengers.

Vintage 1980 Hot Wheels 37 Bugatti Rockwell Antiques Dallas.</h3><p>Of course this was too expensive and labor intensive for a mass produced car. Heavy they were, but weight did not matter at a time when fuel was inexpensive and plentiful. The automobile industry use steel to make the overall frame of the car or the chassis. Specialty metals include platinum, rhodium and palladium in catalytic converters and copper for wiring. This process coats steel with a layer of zinc, most typically by “hot dipping” components in a molten vat of the metal (although painted components see a thinner layer deposited via electroplating). It has about the same properties as being case hardened.</p>
