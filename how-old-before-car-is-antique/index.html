See answer (1) best answer. A car must be at least 20 years old, but not more than 40 years old to be considered a classic car. Some states, though, allow cars to be classified as antique or classic in just 20 years, while others require it to be older. On the average, though, for a car to be considered a classic car it must be at least 25 years old, and 50 years old for it to be considered an antique car.

<p>(you’ll want to consult your state’s specific laws to see its guidelines.) for insurance and registration purposes, the age of a classic car, in most cases, is at least 20 years old but not more than 40 years old. There are some states who will give these plates to cars as young as twenty years old, while others make motorists wait even longer before claiming this tag. Some online selling venues have specific categories that distinguish antiques from collectibles or vintage. However, for registration purposes, many states would consider cars of that age to be antique or vintage automobiles. Classic cars are a subset of a broader category of collector cars.</p>
