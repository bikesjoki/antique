What Insurance Do I Need for a Classic Car or Kit Car? From blog.aisinsurance.com
Antique car insurance is all about protecting a vehicle that actually has value (often more valuable than its purchase price). In some states, an antique car only needs to be at least 20 years old, while the antique automobile club of america regards a car that is at least 45 years old to be antique. Beyond that, classic and antique car insurance averages lower premiums and deductibles because of the care you show your insured car. For example, some insurance companies will need proof of a clean driving record for at least five to10 years.
