<p>Have your friend drive it once a week at least. Before storing your car, change the oil, add fuel stabilizer to the gas tank and run the engine long enough to let the fresh lubricants work their way through the system. Be sure to add the stabilizer to fresh gas. The two biggest things here is 1) that the battery is going to be useless when you return and 2) your wheel bearings would have pitted slightly from the weight of the car pressing down on them without any motion. Daily driving a classic car in hot weather (especially if stuck in gridlocked traffic) with a weak air conditioning system is a sure fire way to fall out of love with your vehicle.</p>
