Is It Time For Your Virginia State Inspection? Cardinal Plaza Shell From cardinalplazashell.com
The car must pass an initial state inspection but is exempt from inspection after that. We can make certain your vehicle is safe to drive under virginia law and certify it as such. Unless your automobile is registered as an antique with virginia’s department of motor vehicles and you do not drive it regularly, you must have an annual safety inspection. For example, the process of applying for custom auto registrations will include a $125 vin inspection fee, a $5 vin plate fee and a titling fee of $10.
