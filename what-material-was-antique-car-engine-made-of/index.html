Parts of a car engine cylinder block, cylinder head, crank case, oil pan, manifolds, gasket, cylinder liner, piston, a piston ring, connecting rod, piston pin, crank shaft, camshaft, flywheels and engine valves. The antique automobile club of america defines an antique car as over 25 years of age. The chain of reactions which achieve that objective is set in motion by a spark, which ignites a mixture of petrol vapour and compressed air inside a momentarily sealed cylinder and causes it to burn rapidly. Cars between 25 and 50 years old are allowed to wear the classic car badge.
