The rules for antique vehicles also apply to campers and trailers. If you own an antique vehicle you do not have to submit it for safety inspection under certain circumstance. Part of the west virginia antique vehicle registration procedure is identifying whether your vehicle classifies as an antique ride or a classic car. Unless the vehicle was manufactured for one license plate only, you must display license plates on the front and the rear of your vehicle.
