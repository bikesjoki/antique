While the basic principle is similar to that on road vehicle usage, operational features are more complex because of the need to control multiple linked carriages and to be effective on vehicles left without a prime mover. This means the switches, relays, plugs/sockets will almost certainly need to be under the track. Cart skips one or more speeds: (3) there are two red lines.

A railway brake is a type of brake used on the cars of railway trains to enable deceleration, control acceleration or to keep them immobile when parked.
