If a car is for personal use, the first $800 is exempt, followed by 3 percent of the next $1,000, and the 2.5 percent afterwards. A classic car is an older car, typically 25 years or older, though definitions vary. If you are going to insure and register it as a classic, it should have been kept to its original specifications and design. The vehicle should be roadworthy, the body should have no rust, the interior should be intact without tears in the upholstery, flooring or header fabric, and the engine should run.
