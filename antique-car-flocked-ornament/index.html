Pin de Oh Joy em christmas party From pinterest.com
Early automobile badges were often made from enameled metal decorated with a company�s name and logo, like the intricate butterfly symbol that branded invicta automobiles in the 1920s ands �30s. There were a great many after market hood ornaments made and sold. These were ornaments that did not come with the car as an original part, but instead were made by companies that sold them to car owners who wanted a hood ornament for a car that either did not come with one or where the car owner wanted something different from what came with. From their plain beginnings as manufacturer’s badges installed on car radiators, hood ornaments evolved into an art form all their own.
