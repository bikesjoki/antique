The term “firearm” does not include an antique firearm unless the antique firearm is used in the commission of a crime. These are usually more serious crimes such as murder, sexual assault, and other types of crimes. Weeks’ conviction was reversed, because upon further review, the court decided that they needed to clarify the rules on possessing antique firearms.in current laws, weeks’ firearm would still not be allowed, because the firearm had a modern scope attached that was not made before 1918, nor was it a replica of an accessory made before 1918.if you plan on carrying an antique. This is irrespective of whether or not the firearm is licensed in their name or belongs to someone else.
