The fire was so intense the cars’ windshields were melting, which only happens once temperatures reach 2,600 degrees or more. We are very proud of our heritage having being established in 1853 and are a forward thinking and progressive business, associated with the major brands in the agricultural industry. If you’re interested in selling antique fire trucks, it’s fast and easy to create a listing with fenton fire. The biggest, of course, being the engine fires.
