Play it safe and add a fuel conditioner. You can also buy lead substitute. This allows moist air into the tank, which gets absorbed by the ethanol in the gas, separates out as water, accumulates at the bottom of the tank, and causes running problems and rust in the tank. As bad as e10 is for today�s cars, ethanol fuel problems are.

<p>In respect to this, when did cars start using unleaded gas? Most of these cars run best on pure gasoline, not gasoline treated with ethanol. The valve train in the old engines requires the cushion/lubrication that lead provided. Cars manufactured before the 1970s were designed to run on leaded gas because lead increased the octane levels and lubricated the engine parts. The rule is your octane should look like your compression ratio.</p>
