White Smoke From Engine? Here�s What To Do! From usedenginefinder.com
It may have been at night, but a flashlight would have helped you find the source. A car can burn oil from an oil leak into the combustion chamber, a failed piston ring, or malfunctioning valve stem seal. This issue will also make the exhaust produce a smell like a burned oil so you should look out for this as well. If the problem is with transmission fluid, it means that the engine is taking fuel through a hosepipe, and this is what leads to white smoke coming out of the tailpipe when you press on the pedal.
