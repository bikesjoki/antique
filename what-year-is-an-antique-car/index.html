<p>Classic cars are a subset of a broader category of collector cars. Enthusiasts sometimes use the terms “classic” and “antique” to mean the same thing, although they have two different meanings. A vintage vehicle covers any passenger car or light commercial originally built before 1948. Moreover, vin numbers can vary from auto to auto and manufacturer to manufacturer. An antique car is anything manufactured from 1975 or earlier according to american car collectors.</p>
