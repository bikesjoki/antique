<p>State of virginia, 30 years in the australian state of queensland, 30 years in sweden and brazil, and 35 years in singapore. Antique vehicle registration is open to anything older than 25 years, but the restrictions are well defined: “antique vehicle” is defined as a vehicle that is 25 years old and older and owned solely as a collector’s item. For example, a plate that was issued in 1927 can only be used on a 1927 model vehicle. On the average, though, for a car to be considered a classic car it must be at least 25 years old, and 50 years old for it to be considered an antique car.</p>
