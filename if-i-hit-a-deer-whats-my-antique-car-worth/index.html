Can you tell me value of such cars now in market as it was noted these are moving into good buys for future. Although some also consider the mileage of the car to be important, it actually is not very significant when valuing antique cars. Most importantly, the vehicle repairs and whether or not they are noticeable has the biggest impact on your trade value. So if your insurance company tells you they calculate the salvage value by 75%, a $10,000 market value car will be worth $7,500 as salvage.
