<p>Manufactured 2000 or earlier (&gt;20 years old) aside from age, you can also determine your car’s classification by looking at its historic status. For a car to be considered a classic, it must be more than 20 years old, in good condition and true to the original design. In short, any car that’s aged 40 years or older is considered to be a classic car, or in official terms, a ‘historic vehicle’. Our motor tax laws define a vintage car as one that’s 30 or more years old. Depending on how you plan to use your vehicle, you may choose antique, vintage or any one of our standard license plates.</p>
