A bad paint job will be hard to correct and is unfortunately something that will be noticed (especially by you). Depending on the quality of the paint job, the type of paint used and the number of coats applied, a good paint job can cost anywhere from a couple thousand dollars up to several thousand dollars. Diy paint jobs cost far less but might not yield the same results. In general, expect to pay anywhere from $300 to upwards of $10,000 for a professional paint job.
