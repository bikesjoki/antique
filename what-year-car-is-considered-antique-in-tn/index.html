Found in Tennessee Barn finds, Antique cars, Antiques.</h3><p>(you’ll want to consult your state’s specific laws to see its guidelines.) for insurance and registration purposes, the age of a classic car, in most cases, is at least 20 years old but not more than 40 years old. However, for registration purposes, many states would consider cars of that age to be antique or vintage automobiles. More than 25 years old. Either a “survivor” or restored in conformance to the original. On the average, though, for a car to be considered a classic car it must be at least 25 years old, and 50 years old for it to be considered an antique car. Generally speaking, antique cars are 45 years or older while classic cars are 20 years or older.</p>
