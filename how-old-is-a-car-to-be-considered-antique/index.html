An antique car is a classification that is often set by state law. The general consensus among australian classic car clubs is that classic cars are vehicles built before 1990, in the following five categories. There is no set classification for what defines a classic car. (you’ll want to consult your state’s specific laws to see its guidelines.) for insurance and registration purposes, the age of a classic car, in most cases, is at least 20 years old but not more than 40 years old.
