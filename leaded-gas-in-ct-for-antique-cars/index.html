<p>These problems went away in the 70�s when computers and oxygen sensors were phased in. If the fuel mixture went lean (too much air and not enough fuel), the computer would allow additional fuel to be added to the engine. These problems are exacerbated in lightly driven vintage cars that often have metal fuel tanks that might be poorly sealed due to degraded or missing emissions systems. You can also buy lead substitute. Most of the time, the lean fuel mixtures were the result of vacuum leaks from vacuum lines and intake manifolds.</p>
