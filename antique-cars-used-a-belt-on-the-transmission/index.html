Everyone must wear a seat belt. As belts operate, belt tension applies a wedging force perpendicular to their tops, pushing their sidewalls against the sides of the sheave grooves, which multiplies frictional forces that allow the drive to transmit higher loads. Some pretty elaborate planetary manual transmissions did evolve, however. Legislation states that if seat belts are fitted in the seat you’re using, they must be worn when the car is being driven.
