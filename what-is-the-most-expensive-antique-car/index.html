Some of the most expensive classic cars ever sold Move to a new phase From phase-2.org
The most expensive vintage car is not 1957 ferrari 250 testa rossa as you thought. Ferrari 250 gto berlinetta (€32.5 million) the record of the most expensive classic car ever sold publicly was set in august 2014 when a red ferrari 250 gto berlinetta was sold for €32.5 million! The majority of cars that sell for tens of millions of dollars are from the 1950s and 1960s. Perhaps surprisingly, the vintage car that ranks as the most expensive was actually crashed twice during its racing days.
